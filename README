Graphics::Simple is a module that emulates something like the graphics
API provided by Commodore-64 or VIC-20 in Perl:

	use Graphics::Simple;

	line(50,50,150,150);
	line(10,10,290,10);
	line(10,290,290,290);

	circle(50,50,25);

This can be rendered on a variety of devices, currently an X window
(using the Gnome Canvas, requiring a recent gnome and gnome-perl interface:
gnome-perl on the Gnome CVS, the CPAN module is out of date) 
or postscript.

See the pod documentation in Simple.pm for details on the operations
provided.
